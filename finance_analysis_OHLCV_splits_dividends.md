# Finance Analysis: OHLCV, Splits, Dividends, and Career Roles
### What is OHLCV?
OHLCV is an acronym representing stock trading data:

O (Open): Price at the start of a time interval.
H (High): Highest price during the interval.
L (Low): Lowest price during the interval.
C (Close): Price at the end of the interval.
V (Volume): Number of shares/contracts traded.

#### Key Points
- OHLCV data forms the basis of financial charts like candlesticks.
- Used in trend analysis, trading strategies, and market visualization.

### What is a Stock Split?
A stock split divides existing shares into multiple new ones while maintaining the company's total market value.

Example:
Pre-split: $100/share, 1M shares.
Post-split (2-for-1): $50/share, 2M shares.

#### Impact:
- Unadjusted data: Shows a sharp drop in price post-split, causing distortions in analysis.
- Adjusted data: Smooths out prices, making historical comparisons consistent.

### What is a Dividend?
A dividend is a company’s profit distribution to shareholders, typically in cash or stock.

Example:
Pre-dividend: $50/share.
Dividend payout: $2/share.
Post-dividend: $48/share (price adjusts).

#### Impact:
- Unadjusted data: Shows a drop in price post-dividend, which can be misleading.
- Adjusted data: Reflects the dividend, ensuring consistent historical analysis.
